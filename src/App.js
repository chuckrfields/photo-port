/* 
 The shorthand condition is called a ternary operator, identified with the ? and : symbols. 
 The ternary operator is a popular pattern in React to enable conditional rendering, 
 similar to how we used the && operator as a short circuit. With the ternary, though, 
 we supply the false condition to render as well.

 Notice the <> and </> that wrap the Gallery and About components. 
 They are called React fragmentsâ€”a shorthand abbreviation for <React.Fragment></React.Fragment>.
